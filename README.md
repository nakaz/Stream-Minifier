# Stream Minifier

> Minification (also minimisation or minimization), in computer programming languages and especially JavaScript, is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from source code without changing its functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include white space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute.

By minifiying our files, we can decrease the size of our asset files (css, js, html) so that our web servers can have higher performance.

In this exercise, create a program callsed `minify.js` that utilizes streams to minify a `css` file.
